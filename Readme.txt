Instructions:

In the source code we have two folders- stage, wifi.

The code for the preliminary "world" in which the robot will be placed is written in the folder named stage while the main logic of our functionality is written in the folder named wifi as "acc.cc".

The wifi folder also contain some already written code provided by the player stage community which we have reused for our project.

To run the code:
1. Go to folder wifi.
2. Type in the terminal- make run

The stage folder contain the following modules:

1. The '.inc' files.
2. The '.world' file.
3. the '.cfg' file.

The subfolder named as bitmaps contains all the images which we have directly included.
To include the functionality of gripper code in acc.cc is to be used.
